When considering the given program, we want to use:
• ofstream to create /tmp/out1, and 
•  fstream to create /tmp/out2.

Fstream and ofstream are both file streams. The difference between them is the
fact that ofstream is an output file stream, hence the o. 

Ofstream is for outputting to files while fstream is used for both reading 
and writing.
Fstream can be used for both input and output. When no mode is set for fstream,
it is opened in input mode by default.

Because of this, we cannot write using fstream. This can be fixed by setting the
mode of fstream by adding ios::out as parameter to get the following:
    fstream out2( "/tmp/out2", ios::out );
This way fstream opens in write mode, and hello(out2) will do the same as
hello(out1) for each corresponding file.
