Redirection is used to redirect the input from a file instead of the standard 
input stream (in the example the file in), or to redirect the output of 
program to a file out instead of the standard output stream.

Piping gives the output of the first command to the command after the piping
operator. Here, the output of program is given to the command less, which
prints the output one screen at a time.
