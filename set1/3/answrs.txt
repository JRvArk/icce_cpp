To provide six additional aspects of C++ compared to C.

1.  In C++ object-oriented programming is possible, enabling the use of
    objects and classes.
2.  C++ offers namespaces, that can be used to avoid collisions between
    identifiers, mostly useful across large programs / libraries.
3.  C++ has exception handling where try, catch, and throw can be used to handle
    errors within the program.
4.  C++ introduces overloading of functions, allowing multiple functions with
    one name but different parameters.
5.  C++ supports templates, where functions and classes can operate on different
    data types without having duplicated code.
6.  C++ has references, which are more intuitive and safer than the pointers C
    uses to achieve similar functionality.
