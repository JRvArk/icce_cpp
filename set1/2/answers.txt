1. What is the difference between a C++ declaration and definition?
A declaration of a variable or function tells the compiler what a name refers
to, and tells its type. A definition does the same, but also provides memory 
in case of a variable, or provides functionality in case of a function.

2. What are header files used for?
Header files are used to separate declarations and definitions, and thus 
constants, functions and classes can be declared and used over multiple source 
files.

3. In what part of creating a program uses the compiler header and libraries?
When a program is compiled, the header files are used first to be included in
the source files, which are then compiled into object files. These are then 
used to link with libraries to then create the final executable.

4. Is a library an object module?
A library is a collection of object modules which can be used to avoid 
recompilation of the same code, so a library is not an object module but a
collection of them.

5. Why is an object file not necessarily an executable program?
This object file is not yet linked with any external libraries which most often
are used. Therefore, the compiled object file is not yet an executable.
