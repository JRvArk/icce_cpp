To find the file sizes, the following commands are used:
    ls -l
    locate iostream
    ls -l /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/14.1.0.2/include/c++/14/iostream
This gives the size of the following files:
    hello.cc:    67 bytes
    hello.o:     6592 bytes
    hello:       14528 bytes
    iostream:    3074 bytes
