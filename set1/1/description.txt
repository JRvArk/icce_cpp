We used the following commands to compile and link the program:
    g++ -Wall -Werr -std=c++26 -c hello.cc -o hello.o
    g++ hello.o -o hello -s
    ./hello > out.txt

The object file is a file that has been compiled from c code to assembly 
code before it is in turn converted into machine code. Next, it is linked with other object 
code files, such as that for iostream, and an executable program is created 
that can be run, which will output the following text: Hello World
