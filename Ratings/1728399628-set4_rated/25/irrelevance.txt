This example shows a simple class describing a bottle with a capacity, where
water can be added or removed. The functions of Bottle are public, and the
data members are private. 
The implementation of the class is irrelevant to show encapsulation and data 
hiding, as the interface provides controlled access and the implementation 
remains hidden from the user.
