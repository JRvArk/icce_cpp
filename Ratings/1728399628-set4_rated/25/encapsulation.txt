Encapsulation involves bundling data and functions operating on that data
into a single unit, which is typically a class. This allows better management 
and interaction with the data.
Data hiding describes that private data inside a class cannot be modified or be 
seen by sections outside the class. This can be done indirectly using public 
member functions of the class implemented by the programmer. This way, due to 
the encapsulation, the class is responsible for its own data integrity.
