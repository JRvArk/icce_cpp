1) what differences exist between pointer variables and arrays:

A pointer variable stores the location of another variable as their value.
An array is a series of elements stored in a contiguous memory location.
The name of the array stores the location of the 0'th index of the array.
An array is a contiguous block in memory, while a pointer refers to one spot.

2) what differences exist between pointer variables and reference variables

A pointer variable stores the location of another variable as their value,
while a reference variable is an alias for an existing variable.

When a reference variable is initialized, it cannot be changed to point to
another variable, while for a pointer variable this is possible.

A reference variable cannot point to a NULL value, pointer variables can.

3a) how element [3][2] is reached for the variable `int array[20][30]'

The size of an array[idx] element is 30 integers. To acces element[3],
we jump 3 * int[30] in memory to get that address. then we jump the size of 2
integers to that location to acces element [3][2].

3b) how element [3][2] is reached for the variable `int *pointer[20]'

The variable pointer is an array of 20 pointers. Firstly, the fourth pointer of
this array is accessed, then this pointer is deferenced such that the array that
it points to is accessed after which the third element is accessed.

4) what is meant by 'pointer arithmetic'

Pointer arithmetic is doing calculations with addresses of variables
to obtain another variable address in memory. Such as increasing/decreasing its 
value, + n/- n, shift to the address n places ahead/before the original pointer.
