// AI: You just mention encapsulation
Data hiding describes that private data inside a specific section, or class, 
cannot be modified or be seen by other sections. This can be done indirectly 
using public member functions of the class implemented by the programmer. This 
way, due to the encapsulation, the class is responsible for it's own data 
integrity.
