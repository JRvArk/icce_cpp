This exercise focuses on implementing a function that returns multiple values using a struct, specifically a 'combine' function that processes command-line arguments and returns information about a requested argument. The exercise also involves creating two different calling functions ('structCall' and 'boundCall') to demonstrate different ways of handling the returned struct, emphasizing code reuse and proper argument handling.
