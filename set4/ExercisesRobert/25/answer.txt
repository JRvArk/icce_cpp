Encapsulation refers to the concept that all data members and member functions
are grouped in a single unit (a class here). Considering classes, all
functions operating on the data member are encapsulated in the unit itself,
thereby ensuring the object's responsibility to maintain the integrity of the
data. Data hiding refers to the concept that the data of a class is not
visible nor accessible by the 'oustide world'. They're private and can only be
accessed through public member functions.

Here is our example:

class Rectangle
{
    size_t d_height;
    size_t d_width;

    public:
        void setHeight(size_t height);
        void setWidth(size_t width);

        size_t height() const;
        size_t width()  const;
        size_t area()   const;
}

For our example, the implementation is irrelevant because the implementation
is realised outside of the class unit. Thereby not illustrating the concepts
of encapsulation and data hiding.
