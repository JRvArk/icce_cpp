In this exercise, we create a Calculator class responsible for making simple
calculations from the input evaluated from cin.

This class also has no constructor. No constructor is needed since we do not
need any instance of Calculator. We have a single static public function, run(),
which can be called directly on the class itself with no need to create a
Calculator object. Next to that, Calculator has no non-static data members that 
work independently of class states.
