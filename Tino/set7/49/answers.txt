The program is executed with and without if-statement.

• Time using the if-statement:
    +------+-----------+
    | real |  0m9.990s |
    +------+-----------+
    | user |  0m9.566s |
    +------+-----------+
    |  sys |  0m0.303s |
    +------+-----------+
• Time without the if-statement:
    +------+-----------+
    | real | 0m12.678s |
    +------+-----------+
    | user | 0m12.440s |
    +------+-----------+
    |  sys |  0m0.126s |
    +------+-----------+

The difference in execution time can be explained with the overhead caused by
the insertion operator. When we set the state to failbit, the insertion operator
is never used when we have the if-statement. This results in lower runtimes than
compared to when we do use the if-statement.

We can formulate a general rule of thumb from this; when execution time is
important, then explicit failbit checks should be used.
