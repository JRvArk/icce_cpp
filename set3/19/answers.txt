In what situation is it appropriate to

1) define an int-type parameter?

It is appropriate to use an int-type parameter when we need to work (modify)
with numbers without the original int-type being changed. In the code example 
this is illustrated because we make calculations on a copy and then display
it to cout.

    void printCalculations(size_t value)
                             // MIN_VALUE is an enum.
        while(value < MIN_VALUE)
            value *= 2;
        cout << value << '\n';

2) define a std::string value parameter?

It is appropriate to use a string value parameter when passing by value.
The entire string is copied so only use this when a copy is required and
when you want the original to be unchanged. In
the code example this is illustrated because a copy of s1 is made and 
modified. At the end of main two strings exist.

string addDot(string s)
{
    return s.append(".");
}

int main()
{
    string s1 = "This is a string";

    string s2 = addDot(s1);
}

3) define a const reference to an int-type parameter?

It is not appropriate to use a const reference to an int-type parameter as
int-types are rather small, and it would be more efficient or appropriate to
use a const int-type parameter.


4) define a const reference to a std::string value parameter?

It is appropriate to use a const reference parameter when you do not need to 
modify the string. A copy is not desirable, as objects are often of such
a size that using a reference is more efficient than using a copy.
In the code example this is illustrated because the contents
of s are not modified.

void print(string const &s)
{
    cout << s;
}

5) define a non-const reference to an int-type parameter?

It is appropriate to use a non const reference to an int-type parameter when
the aim of the function is to modify the given argument. That is, when passing
by reference is the aim. In the code example this is illustrated because
we define and initialize a value, which is modified by the function add 5.
Modified, thus a non-const reference is needed.

add5(int &value)
{
    value += 5;
}

int main()
{
    int value = 10;
    add5(value);    // value is now 15.
}

6) define a non-const reference to a std::string value parameter?

It is appropriate to use a non-const reference to a string as parameter when 
the string given as argument is to be modified. In the code example this is
illustrated because the string that was initialized is the first line of main
is now appended with dot. That is, we need to pass by reference and use a 
non-const parameter.

void addDot(string &s)
{
    s.append(".");
}

int main()
{
    string s1{"hello"};

    addDot(s1); // now: hello.
}

7) define a const rvalue-reference to an int-type parameter?

It is appropriate to use const rvalue-references when you do not want to use 
a copy nor want to modify a temporary value. In the code example this is
illustrated because the temporary string is not copied but binded to an rvalue
reference x, which is then printed to the standard output stream. This saves 
memory by not having to allocate memory for an lvalue.

void printRvalue(int const &&integer)
{
    cout << integer << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    printRvalue(5);
}

8) define a const rvalue-reference to a std::string parameter?

It is appropriate to use const rvalue-references when you do not want to use 
a copy nor want to modify a temporary value. In the code example this is
illustrated because the temporary string is not copied but binded to an rvalue
reference x, which is then printed to the standard output stream. This saves 
memory by not having to allocate memory for an lvalue.

void printRvalue(string const &&str)
{
    cout << str << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    printRvalue("temporary");
}

9) define an rvalue-reference to an int-type parameter?


10) define an rvalue-reference to a std::string parameter?

11) return an int-type value?

It is appropriate to use an int-type return value when you want to return a
copy of an integer. This is useful when, for example, you want to sum two
integers together and print the sum to the standard output stream.
In the code example this is illustrated because we have an
