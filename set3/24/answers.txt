The -O2 flag tells the compiler to do optimizations on the code, does all the optimizations to
make the code smaller and run faster without making it take more space during execution. This
comes at the cost of a longer compilation time. 

The -O1 flag tells the compiler to optimize the code but to a lesser degree than -O2. This
flags only makes the compiler do optimizations that minimally impact compilation time. 

The -O3 flag tells the compiler to optimize the code for speed at the cost of memory 
efficiency. It does all the -O2 optimizations and more, which greatly increases compilation time.
